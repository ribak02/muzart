# Abstract
The shift towards the digital museum reflects a significant change in the cultural sector, moving beyond physical museum spaces to digital platforms accessible worldwide. As preservers of cultural heritage, museums face challenges with traditional collection management methods amid evolving curatorial practices and exhibition. Blockchain technology offers a viable solution, enhancing collection transparency and audience interaction. Muzart, an Ethereum-based blockchain platform, emerges as a comprehensive ecosystem for managing and democratizing museum collections. Allowing users to explore, mint, and own digital NFT artifacts through ERC-1155 tokens which is supported by the IPFS for decentralized storage. This setup ensures transparent, immutable records of artifact ownership, addressing the limitations of physical artifact preservation and traditional record-keeping. Despite the rigidity of smart contracts posing challenges to adaptability, Muzart's approach significantly enhances museum collection management, operational transparency, and audience engagement, marking a progressive step in integrating blockchain technology within museums and cultural heritage. Future efforts aimed at enhancing scalability, integration with decentralized autonomous organizations, and refining content verification procedures will establish Muzart as a leading platform in digitally preserving and making cultural heritage accessible.
