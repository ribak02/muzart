  "description": "3D model of a replica of the statue described below. Legend has it that the statue was found in a barn wall on the farm at Skriðuklaustur. Carved from oak, it is 71 cm tall and was probably carved in Northern Europe in the late 15th century. The Holy Mother Mary is sitting on a chair, wearing a crown, and holding the baby Jesus on her knee. The wood was originally partly painted in blue and red. In 1950 the National Museum of Iceland purchased the statue from the collection of Pike Ward, who collected it sometime around 1900. The statue is believed to have stemmed from the Cloister church because, like the monastery itself, the church was dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Furthermore, 17th- and 18th-century church audits mention that there was a statue of Mary there. The original is kept at the National Museum of Iceland and the replica is kept at the Gunnar Gunnarsson Institute.
